    "## ■ How this section relates to optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "User modeling enables the input and consideration of specific information of an individual user with the aim of optimizing the service, which usually takes the form of service customization. It is obvious that a service without useful information about an individual user cannot optimally adapt the service to this user.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most comprehensive information about a user is their membership of a user segment. We assign the users of a service to certain classes, which we call segments - the result of the segmentation process. These procedures place the individual user in the context of other users. Segmentation methods were developed in the related fields of marketing, but are also applicable to the optimization framework with users.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of adapting to the person himself, independently of other users, is called personalization. It includes information about the user, such as personality and history of their activities, which is collected in the user model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Studies show that the user's situation during the actual use of the service is the key to optimization and is usually more important than personalization. The user's situation is referred to as the context. It is described with a tree structure, where the first branch includes three components, namely time (e.g. time of day, day of week, etc.), location (e.g. at home, on the road, at work) and activity (what the user is currently doing while using the app). By recognizing and considering the context, we achieve situational awareness for the service.\n",
    "\n",
    "User modeling includes useful information about the user's previous usage and usage behavior within the overall user group for optimization. The algorithms for user modeling are very diverse. We cover here Markov chains (a random sequence of events/activities) and lattice modeling with matrix factorization approaches.\n",
